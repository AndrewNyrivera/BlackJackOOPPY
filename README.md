# BlackJackOOPPY
## This is my first Object Oriented Game
## This is a simple Black Jack Console Game!
### This was to show my advancement from using simple functions to creating a full game using more complicated Object Oriented Programming
### This had taken me a bit to understand since OOP was very different to me then regular functions, I had to think about how my code will effect the rest of the program and how to loop it all together in the end. This was a very fun project for me that I felt really pushed my understanding and was my first step into becoming an intermediate python programmer. I have all my notes outlined in the code so that for any beginner programmers can look through and see my thought process, to better understand how to think like a programmer.
