# BlackJackOOPPY
## This is my first Object Oriented Game
## This is a simple Black Jack Console Game!
### This was to show my advancement from using simple functions to creating a full game using more complicated Object Oriented Programming
### This had taken me a bit to understand since OOP was very different to me then regular functions, I had to think about how my code will effect the rest of the program and how to loop it all together in the end. This was a very fun project for me that I felt really pushed my understanding and was my first step into becoming an intermediate python programmer. I have all my notes outlined in the code so that for any beginner programmers can look through and see my thought process, to better understand how to think like a programmer.
#### Btw my code can be shortened and improved for instance the checks who wins should have been function, same thing if a player gets blackjack and would return a boolean value that can be later used to more easily run code within the game loop, but the point of this program was to show the striaght forward way to show how OOP works. I know I have learned a lot and it was a lot of fun!
